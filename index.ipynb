    "__Inference:__ Once again, the number of points does not have much affect of the segmentation accuracy. It could be possible that, as discussed earlier the model relies on global position of each point, and hence reducing points does not affect its performance. In contrast, if the model depended on relationships between points, with fewer points, it would be difficult to segment and in that case the accuracy might have been affected by number of points. But it would also ensure actual robust performance.  "
